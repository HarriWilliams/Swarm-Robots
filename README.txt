Usage Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------
- This application simulates the swarming behaviours of 
animals found in nature via simulated swarm robots. These 
robots will track the user's mouse and will form into 
shapes when they reach the mouse. Different shapes can be 
formed by selecting the shapes on the right hand side of 
the GUI. The robots only have a limited range where they 
can see the goal, so if they are too far away from the 
mouse they will not see it.

- This program can only be run from a Java IDE. The IntelliJ 
IDEA was used in the process of deveoping this program. For 
the best results, use the IntelliJ IDEA.

- Open up the file Simulator in your IDE and then run it.
